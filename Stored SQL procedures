create a Sql server database e.g. "BookDb" and in that 
create a table using the script below:

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[BookDetails]
(
                [BookName] [varchar](100),
                [Author] [varchar](100),
                [Publisher] [varchar](200),
                [Price] [decimal](18, 2) NOT NULL
)


Now create the stored procedure to insert the book details in the table.

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[InsertBookDetails_SP]
                @BookName                    VARCHAR(100),
                @Author                             VARCHAR(100),
                @Publisher                        VARCHAR(200),
                @Price                                 DECIMAL(18,2)
AS
BEGIN
INSERT INTO BookDetails
 (
    BookName,Author,Publisher,Price
 )
   VALUES
(
   @BookName,@Author,@Publisher,@Price
)
END

Create a stored procedure to update the book detail

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[UpdateBookRecord_SP]     
                @BookName                    VARCHAR(100),
                @Author                      VARCHAR(100),
                @Publisher                    VARCHAR(200),
                @Price                        DECIMAL(18,2)
AS
BEGIN
                UPDATE BookDetails SET
                                BookName=@BookName,
                                Author=@Author,
                                Publisher=@Publisher,
                                Price=@Price
                WHERE BookName=@BookName
END

Create a stored procedure to delete book record

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[DeleteBookRecords_Sp]
                @BookName            VARCHAR(100)
AS
BEGIN
                DELETE FROM BookDetails WHERE  BookName=@BookName
END

Create a stored procedure to delete book record

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[FetchBookRecords_Sp]
AS
BEGIN
                SELECT * FROM BookDetails
END



Now we need to connect our asp.net application with the sql server database.
So in the web.config file create the connection string under the <configuration> tag as:

<connectionStrings>
    <add name="conStr" connectionString="Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=BooksDb;Integrated Security=True"/>
  </connectionStrings>

Now database part is done.  
Now it's time to write the code for each layer.
